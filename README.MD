ToDo:

1. Generate our accuracy.
2. Creating biased users, since randomly generating ratings for songs will just create a random tree structure. So maybe a user more into rock, one more into pop etc. As well as last lisented to date. This will help us avoid a song being suggested back to back. Help trim down the similar subsets.

      
To run:

<<<<<<< HEAD
*Make sure you add the sqlite-jdbc-3.15.1.jar in the libs folder to the build path, as well as src/data folder as a resource folder.
=======
*Make sure you add the preprocessor to the build path, as well as mysqlconnector jar file. Both of the jars are in the libs folder. Also add the data folder inside src to the build path.
