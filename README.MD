ToDo:

1. Generate our accuracy.
2. Creating biased users, since randomly generating ratings for songs will just create a random tree structure. So maybe a user more into rock, one more into pop etc. As well as last lisented to date. This will help us avoid a song being suggested back to back. Help trim down the similar subsets.
3. Report.
5. GUI
      
To run:

*Make sure you add the preprocessor to the build path, as well as mysqlconnector jar file. Both of the jars are in the libs folder.
