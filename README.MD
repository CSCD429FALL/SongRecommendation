ToDo:

      
*Make the results more accurate by adding genre values from additional data in the million song dataset website.

*Creating biased users, since randomly generating ratings for songs will just create a random tree structure.
So maybe a user more into rock, one more into pop etc.

*Retrieve the most fitting subsets and return it as a playlist or further filter it down then randomly select one and return just the one song.
      
songs.csv is not included since its too large. This file can be generated from the sqlite file.
