# spandora

ToDo:

1. Implement the ability to split continous attributes in a more robust way. 
2. Take the tag information from the original Million song data set and split it into multiple columns. Remove duplicates such as same tag but with different symbols, or spelled differently.

      
To run:
*Make sure you add the sqlite-jdbc-3.15.1.jar in the libs folder to the build path, as well as src/data folder as a resource folder.
