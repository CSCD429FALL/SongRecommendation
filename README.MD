ToDo:

      
*Creating biased users, since randomly generating ratings for songs will just create a random tree structure.
So maybe a user more into rock, one more into pop etc.

*Retrieve the most fitting subsets and return it as a playlist or further filter it down then randomly select one and return just the one song.
      
To run:

*Make sure you add the preprocessor to the build path, as well as mysqlconnector jar file. Both of the jars are in the libs folder.
