ToDo:

1. Creating biased users, since randomly generating ratings for songs will just create a random tree structure. So maybe a user more into rock, one more into pop etc. As well as last lisented to date. This will help us avoid a song being suggested back to back. Help trim down the similar subsets.

      
To run:
*Make sure you add the sqlite-jdbc-3.15.1.jar in the libs folder to the build path, as well as src/data folder as a resource folder.
