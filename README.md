ToDo:

      <ol>
         <li>Make the results more accurate by adding the tags from the tags tables.</li>
         <lie>Creating biased users, since randomly generating ratings for songs will just create a random tree structure.
               So maybe a user more into rock, one more into pop etc.</li>
         <li>Retrieve the most fitting subsets and return it as a playlist or further filter it down then randomly select one and return just the one song.</li>
      </ul>
