ToDo:<br> 
    *Make the results more accurate by adding the tags from the tags tables. 
    
    *Creating biased users, since randomly generating ratings for songs will just create a random tree structure.
     So maybe a user more into rock, one more into pop etc.
    
    *Retrieve the most fitting subsets and return it as a playlist or further filter it down then randomly select one and return just the       one song.
